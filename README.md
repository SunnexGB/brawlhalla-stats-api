## Installation

Install the package using npm:

```javascript
npm i brawlhalla-stats-api
```

## Data source

This library interacts with brawlhalla statistics api located at https://api.brawlhalla.fr/. api is not officially documented on the main website https://stats.brawlhalla.fr/, and data is accessed by parsing api endpoints directly.

## Parsing method

Data is retrieved by navigating api directory structure, specifically from angular web application located at https://api.brawlhalla.fr/angularwebapp2/. This parsing method allows a not entirely but interaction with api, providing access to the most up-to-date statistics.

Important note about third-party code by [Th√©o Beaudenon](https://theo-beaudenon.fr/)
This library uses parsing locales. While api endpoints are publicly available, please be aware that use of this data is subject to the terms and conditions of the original source.
